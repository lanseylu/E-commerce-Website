# E-commerce Website
## By Lanchelot D. Lucero (Lance)

This is a project I made back in my second year in college. To use this, just install XAMPP/Apache, drag this folder to htdocs, and run on your localhost. To setup the database, just import it to MySQL in phpmyadmin page.

In this project, I learned to use PHP, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and MySQL to create a dynamic and visually-appealing website. Users can add to cart, adjust item quantity on their carts, fill up shipping forms, view their total, and browse through items with ease and intuition.

Images are not mine and only used for practice.
